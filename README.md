# TodayJS
This is a simple JS project that will show the current Date on a minimal card design , The information shown is currently the current date , day , month & year.


## Plans
* Ensure it works for all formats of Dates
* Add suffix to the date (3rd , 2nd ect)
* Maybe add "events" like christmas as a display
